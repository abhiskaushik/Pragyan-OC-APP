Pragyan-OC-APP
==============

The two modules are the Oc-App for NIT-TRICHY's technical fest so called  'Pragyan'. 
These modules are created under Pragyan-CMS.
The App deals about:
1.Online Registrations for fest's "food coupons" and "T.shirts".
2.App is maintained by three roles
  a.OC(organising committee) Head i.e OC Head
  b.OC-Team
  c.Registrants/visitors
3.Oc Head can view the registered users,he can upload excel sheet of the whitelist emails, i.e college students who are really eligible to get the facility.
4.He/she can also remove or add any registrant,moreover they can get the current status of registration and based on that can order for coupons and T.shirts.
5.Oc-Team works during the distribution process, where they scan the I-card of students and get the roll and then check if he/she is a whitelist user or not. If whitelist registrants  get their things.
    To use this app one has to install pragyan-cms and then include the file oc.lib.php and the folder oc  in the cms/module folder and then one can use it.
    Thanks.
